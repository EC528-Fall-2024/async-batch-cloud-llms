Sally Seddon said her dad Ian Darnell, who died aged 66, was a true Coventry Kid, great in height at 6ft 5in and heart, whose team mates nicknamed the ‘Honey Monster’. Ian was full-time carer to Carol, his wife of 38 years, who was diagnosed with dementia in 2006, when she was only 61. The grandad and dad-of-two helped set up the Young Onset Dementia Focus Group and was a big advocate of giving carers a voice to get the support and recognition they deserve, Sally said. The 35-year-old, whose sister is Amy, aged 37, said: “Dad was devoted to mum and the compassion and care he showed to her through the years, but particularly since she became poorly, is a testament to their love for each other. “Mum will miss him greatly.” Ian worked for the youth offending team and workmates have told how there are many young people in the city who have indirectly benefited from his influence. Aside from his family, his other great passion was rugby. He captained Coventry Rugby Club and coached the team. He also captained Warwickshire and coached the England Colts (Under 19s) and as part of this had to select young international players. The Telegraph earlier published a tribute from Coventry club president Peter Rossborough who said Ian would almost certainly have played for his country but for his injuries. Sally added: “My sister and I feel incredibly fortunate and privileged to have had him as our dad and we are so proud of how he lived his life. ""Whilst we have our own personal grief as a family, we know from the abundance of messages, cards and calls we have received that there are many who will miss him also. “We have had contact from people who knew dad in a professional capacity from the police and the youth offending service, through to his rugby pals and contempories and of course from his many friends and neighbours, and it is clear that he was highly thought of and well respected across the board. “They are all saying what we know ourselves to be true, that he was a genuinely lovely man, he had a great sense of humour, a warm wit, spoke many a wise word and was a true gentleman. “He was one of the good guys. The world was a better place for having had him in it and he will be dearly missed.” His funeral was due to be held at Canley Crematorium yesterday. Watch: Christopher Eccleston talks about dementia"

Few people realise that a little known section of the 2003 Licensing Act makes it illegal for you to buy booze for someone who has had too much. It also bans bar staff from serving customers who are clearly under the influence. Premises that do could be stripped of their licence. It is not known, however, if the law has ever been enforced in Coventry and Warwickshire. Dr John Larsen, director of evidence and impact for Drinkaware, said: “It has been against the law to buy alcohol for someone who is drunk and even to serve someone who is clearly drunk for some time now, but not everyone is aware of this. “While we recognise that many people enjoy drinking on a night out, the law exists to protect people from potential alcohol related harm. “Binge drinking can be extremely dangerous. Your body can only process one unit of alcohol an hour, and less in some people. “Drink a lot in a short space of time and the amount of alcohol in the blood can stop the body from working properly. “If you do drink too much, you could easily get into trouble – problems include breathing problems, seizures and brain damage. “The more drunk you are, the more likely you are to do something risky. “If you do chose to drink alcohol, it is best to stick within the recommended lower risk guidelines of 14 units of alcohol a week for both men and women, and to spread your drinks over three days or more.”"
